Sublime Text 2 Completions for RubyMotion
==========================================

This is a quick and dirty port of the completions generated by [RubyMotion.tmBundle](https://github.com/libin/RubyMotion.tmbundle). As such, I'm not sure if there are any missing methods or not, but feel free to contribute if you find some.

Installation
------------

Put this package into your Sublime Text 2 packages folder:

**Windows**: %APPDATA%\Sublime Text 2\Packages  
**OS X**: ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages  
**Linux**: ~/.Sublime Text 2/Packages

Usage
-----

Inside your RubyMotion project just start typing the name of a method and the autocomplete window will pop up.  
Press enter/return to trigger the completion.
